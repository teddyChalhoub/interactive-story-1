Room escape

Introduction:

One day, five teenagers sitting in a pub. While having fun, a stranger approached them and gave them a piece of paper, saying: “ DON’T BE LATE  TONIGHT!! ” with a title Room escape game. They noticed a location written at the bottom of the paper. Will they go to CHECK the game? Or will they stay in the pub?

Chapter 1:

This message aroused their curiosity. They have to decide if they are going to the specified location and check the game or let it pass like nothing happened. If they decided to go, they should go to the specified location. If not they would stay in the pub.

Chapter 2:

They decided to go. When they reached the location, they found a normal building. So they knocked on the door, and here’s the shock. It was that stranger. She greeted and invited them in  to explain the game. They found out that they have to fill a form and sign on terms. Anything can happen in the game even death which they are responsible for. They have two options either accept the terms and sign or quit. If they signed the terms, they would start the game. If they didn’t, they have to leave.

Chapter 3:

Here we go, welcome to the game. She guided them through a long spooky hall to reach a room called “ THE START OF THE END”. They entered the room and met the game instructor. He showed them were they can find each room rules. They have the right to ask for one hint in each room. The instructor suddenly disappeared. Let the game begin. They went to the board and read the instructions. They have to solve a couple of riddles. One of them was “I HAVE CITIES, BUT NO HOUSES. I HAVE MOUNTAINS, BUT NO TREES. I HAVE WATERS BUT NO FISH. WHAT AM I?”. if they solve this riddle they get a key and reach the next level (Room 2). if they don’t they have to sacrifice one of their friends and keep them locked somewhere unknown in the building or all of them will be dead.

Chapter 4:

They decided to imprison one of them. They went to the stage 2. In this stage they have to reach the key with physical activities. One of them have to climb to a rope covered by oil and under it there is spikes. If they climb it, they will get the key. If they don’t, one of them should battle against a wild boar and get the key from their neck. 

Chapter 5:

  They took the key and jumped to next stage. The second they entered the room, they saw their friend covered by red stinky substance. They were surprised and astonished. They thought it was blood but it wasn’t. They could not bear the smell of the room. As a mission, they had to write a paragraph in Spanish. They used the hint in this stage, which was “GOOGLE IT”, to know how to do it. They had three trials. If they consume them all they have to go back to square one. If the pass they save their friend and go to next stage.

Chapter 6:

in the next stage, they had to drink fake poison from the container. Either they will drink it and pass.  Or they will fight each other until one of them is still standing. They will reach the end of the game  and win 1$.
